Spthui: a very very ugly libspotify player client example
=========================================================

...now backed up on the Internet. First of all:


	This product uses Music by Spotify but is not endorsed,
	certified or otherwise approved in any way by Spotify.
	Spotify is the registered trade mark of the Spotify Group.


Second of all, this is by no means an attempt to have a real usable
client, but rather an experiment in using libspotify, the client
library released by Spotify.


Requirements
=============

  * libspotify (at least 12.1.51 "tested" to work)
    https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/

  * alsa development packages

  * gtk2 or gtk3 development packages


If that didn't put you off yet, for running you'll need:

   * A Spotify premium account

   * A libspotify application key as a binary blob in $HOME/.spthui/key
   ** which you need to request yourself, of course. Distributing a
      readily readable key with open source software is probably not
      smart. Or even allowed.


Building
=========

The Makefile uses pkg-config(1) to probe for GTK libraries. It will
first try gtk+-3.0, and if that's not found, gtk+-2.0. There's a fair
amount of compatibility gunk to ensure spthui works equally badly
on either.

To force building with the GTK2 ui:

  make clean all UI=gtk2

or GTK3, unsurprisingly:

  make clean all UI=gtk3


If the build falls apart you'll need to adjust the makefile. I am sorry.


Running
=======

  ./spthui

There's a lot of debugging output (both from libspotify and spthui) on
the console, because this is not a real product.


Spthui does not contain any playlist management functionality. It will
show your existing playlists, which you can expand by double-clicking
them. There's also a context menu on pretty much every list-type of
thing.

And there's a search field, not unlike the one on the real Spotify
client. Try it. The results look horrible by design. There, I said
'design'.
